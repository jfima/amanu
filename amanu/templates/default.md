### PART 2: Structured Knowledge Base
- **Header**: `# Структурированный конспект` (or equivalent in audio language).
- **Format**: This is NOT just a short summary. It is a detailed, structured representation of the content.
- **Sections**:
    - **Title**: A clear, descriptive title.
    - **Date/Context**: (If mentioned in audio).
    - **Participants**: List of speakers.
    - **Detailed Content**: Break down the audio into logical sections/chapters.
        - Use clear headings for each topic change.
        - Use paragraphs for detailed explanation of what was said.
        - Use bullet points for lists or key takeaways within sections.
    - **Action Items / Conclusions**: Specific tasks or final decisions.

**Style Guidelines:**
- Be accurate and objective.
- Do not use conversational filler.
- Ensure the "Structured Knowledge Base" is comprehensive enough to replace listening to the audio for most purposes.
