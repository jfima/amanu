## Instructions for formatting the clean transcript

Format the cleaned transcript as a structured markdown document with the following sections:

### 1. Title
- Create a clear, descriptive title based on the conversation topic
- Use `# Title` format

### 2. Metadata (if applicable)
- Date/Context (if mentioned)
- Participants list

### 3. Main Content
- Break down the conversation into logical sections with clear headings (`## Section Name`)
- Use paragraphs for detailed explanations
- Use bullet points for lists or key takeaways
- Group related statements by speaker and topic
- Remove filler words and fix grammar

### 4. Action Items / Conclusions (if applicable)
- List specific tasks or decisions made
- Use checkbox format: `- [ ] Task description`

**Style Guidelines:**
- Be accurate and objective
- Use clear, professional language
- Ensure the transcript is comprehensive and well-organized
- Output in the same language as the audio
